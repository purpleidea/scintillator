This is some software that I wrote around 2007.
This software is used to read from the serial port of a scintillation counter.
See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintillation_counter for some information.
This was developed for, and tested on, an old Packard TRI-CARB machine.
I don't remember the specific model number, but you could adapt this as needed.
Many older scintillation counters are still in use today and work great!
They were quite expensive to purchase initially, as are newer models.
One downside with the older versions is that data comes out by line printer.
Researchers would then have to transcribe the data manually to a spreadsheet.
The benefit of this software is that you get a digital copy without the work!
The data also comes out at a higher precision. I'm not sure if this is needed.
For this to work, some parameters must be set in a certain way on the machine.
I never thought about releasing this code publicly until now.
Since it was written a while back, please excuse any inexperience in the code.

I am always interested in helping research and researchers for the greater good.
Please feel free to track down university labs who struggle with their machine.
If they need assistance in getting this going, please feel free to contact me.

WARNING: this machine processes vials containing radioactive fluid!
You must have proper supervision to be near, and work on one of these machines.
